SQL - More Queries

This repository contains examples and explanations for advanced SQL queries using MySQL. If you're already familiar with basic SQL operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, this guide will take you further by exploring more complex query scenarios and techniques.

Introduction

In this section, we dive deeper into SQL queries, focusing on more advanced topics to enhance your database querying skills. We'll cover topics like subqueries, joins, aggregate functions, and more. Each topic includes practical examples to help you understand how to use these techniques effectively.

## Subqueries

Subqueries, also known as nested queries, allow you to use the result of one query as input to another query. This powerful technique helps you solve complex problems and write more efficient queries.

## Joins

Joins enable you to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. Learn how to use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and OUTER JOIN to retrieve data from different tables.

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX are used to perform calculations on a set of values. Discover how to utilize these functions to summarize and analyze data.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. They improve query readability and maintainability.

## Window Functions

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Explore ranking, partitioning, and analytics functions to solve complex analytical queries.

## Advanced Filtering

Dive into advanced filtering techniques using the HAVING clause to filter results based on aggregate function values and explore the benefits of using CASE statements.

## Indexes and Performance

Learn how to optimize your queries by understanding indexes, their types, and how they can significantly improve database performance.

## Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed later. Discover how to create, execute, and manage stored procedures.

## Transactions

Transactions ensure the integrity of the database by grouping one or more SQL statements into a single unit of work. Learn how to use transactions effectively.

## Views

Views are virtual tables created from the result of a SELECT query. They provide an abstraction layer and simplify complex queries and report generation.

## Conclusion

By mastering these advanced SQL query techniques, you'll be better equipped to tackle complex data manipulation tasks and optimize database performance.
